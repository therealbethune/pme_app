## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Coverage Command
```bash
# Before
pytest tests/test_pme_app_basic.py tests/services/test_analysis.py --cov=pme_app --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=5 -q

# After
pytest tests/ --cov=pme_app --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html --cov-fail-under=5 -q
```

### Artifact Structure
```
coverage-report/
├── coverage.xml          # XML report for Codecov
├── coverage.svg          # Badge SVG file
├── htmlcov/             # HTML coverage report
│   ├── index.html       # Main coverage page
│   └── ...              # Individual file reports
└── .coverage            # Raw coverage data
```

### Badge Integration
- **Local Badge**: `./coverage.svg` (auto-updated by CI)
- **Codecov Badge**: External service with detailed metrics
- **CI Badge**: GitHub Actions workflow status

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Current Coverage Metrics
- **Total Coverage**: 8.84%
- **Threshold**: 5% (met ✅)
- **Files Covered**: All pme_app modules
- **Test Files**: 78 tests across multiple test files

### Coverage Breakdown
- `pme_app/services/portfolio.py`: 94% (excellent)
- `pme_app/__init__.py`: 100% (trivial)
- Most other modules: 0% (opportunity for improvement)

## 🚀 CI Workflow Enhancements

### New Steps Added

2. **Codecov Upload**: External coverage tracking
3. **Badge Generation**: Automatic SVG badge creation
4. **Artifact Upload**: Coverage reports available for download
5. **Badge Commit**: Automatic badge updates on main branch

### Permissions & Security
- **Contents Write**: Required for badge commits
- **Pull Requests Write**: For PR coverage comments
- **Conditional Execution**: Badge commits only on main branch pushes

## 📊 Coverage Reports Available

### 1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**
- Download from CI run artifacts
- Includes XML, HTML, and raw data
- Available for 90 days (GitHub default)

### 2. **HTML Coverage Report**
