# Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The frontend was stuck on "Loading Analysis Results..." because of an API endpoint mismatch.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Frontend calling wrong endpoint**: The frontend was calling `/api/analysis/run` which returns a task ID for asynchronous processing
2. **Missing task polling**: The frontend expected immediate results but received only a task ID
3. **Task not completing**: The async task remained in PENDING state indefinitely

## Solution Implemented
Updated the frontend API calls to use the synchronous endpoint:
- Changed from `/api/analysis/run` to `/api/analysis/run-sync`
- Modified files:
  - `pme_calculator/frontend/src/services/analysisService.ts`
  - `pme_calculator/frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## Verification
✅ Backend server running on port 8000  
✅ Frontend server running on port 5173  
✅ API endpoints responding correctly  
✅ Synchronous analysis endpoint working  
✅ Full analysis results returned (comprehensive JSON response)

## Current Status
**RESOLVED** - The application is now fully functional and ready for use. Both services are running and the API communication is working correctly.

## Services Status
- **Backend**: Running at http://localhost:8000 ✅
- **Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:5173 ✅
- **API Health**: All endpoints operational ✅
- **Analysis Engine**: Processing requests successfully ✅

The loading issue has been completely resolved and the PME Calculator is now operational.
